===============================
A "Frogger"-like game that requires a player to advance across a hazardous roadway, dodging enemy bugs, to reach a river.  Collision with bugs cost the player's life - as does failing to cross before a timer runs out. Fortunately a "bonus star" allows players a chance to add "extra lives." But beware: enemies multiply as the game continues.

TO PLAY:
1. Download the game files via GitHub at https://github.com/RxBx/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

2. Open the file "index.html" in your browser... The game starts immediately.

HOW TO PLAY:
- You have 3 lives at the beginning of the game.
- Use arrow buttons to move the player up, down, left, right.
- You have 15 seconds to move the player to the water at top of screen, or you lose your life. Reaching the water awards you 10 points.
- Avoid the enemy insects crossing the screen on the stone/street rows; if they hit the player, you lose your life.
- A "Bonus Star" appears every 5 seconds, and stays on screen for about 3 seconds. If you move the player onto the Bonus Star, you are awarded an extra player life.
- Game is over when you lose all of your lives.
